# express-headlines
Looking at the Daily Express weather headlines. For academic purposes.

python packages I installed:
- jupyter 
- beautifulsoup4
- numpy and pandas
- keras
- xarray
- cftime
- matplotlib

and like all their dependencies and stuff

I'm so good at writing documentation

wouldn't look at the jupyter notebook online because i uh. may have printed out five years of headlines on it, multiple times. 
they're pretty funny tho
